## My process

  I firstly divided each part of the page using "div's" and then style each of them accordingly using using flexbox.
  
## Built with

- HTML 5
- Custom CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned 

``` css
@media only screen and (min-width: 375px) and (max-width: 1440px){}
.page-wrapper > .page-content > .qr-code-banner {
  width: auto;
}
.page-wrapper > .page-content > .qr-code-banner > img {
    border-radius: inherit;
}
```

### Continued development

- Improve use of flexbox and CSS grid efficiently
- Media queries for mobile and desktop sizing
- Time management in project development

### Useful resources
- [Resource 1](https://www.alison.com) - This helped me in learning how to build a website using flexbox and CSS grid. The pattern was a very good approach in writing codes and styling it.
